# Bank-Loan-Analysis

This Bank Customer Analysis project explores relationships between various financial products and customer demographics using PostgreSQL, Python, and Power BI. By analyzing variables like income, deposits, savings, loans, and credit balances, the project uncovers meaningful insights into customer behavior and banking habits. A strong correlation was observed between checking accounts, deposits, and savings, indicating bundled product usage. The analysis also highlights how income modestly impacts product engagement across the board.
The project demonstrates a full data analytics pipelineâ€”from raw SQL querying and Python-based EDA to interactive data visualization. The final Power BI dashboard offers an intuitive interface for stakeholders to drill down into customer segments, helping inform data-driven decisions in marketing, cross-selling, and product development.
